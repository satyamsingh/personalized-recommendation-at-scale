How do we query large amount of vectors in efficient time?\n","2. How can we infer various user representations and see what their impact is on the downstream task?\n","\n","Let's begin with the former, which tells us how we could handle a large number of candidate items or user representations in an efficient manner: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search.  \n","  \n","<br>Often we are interested in finding nearest neighbors in a large space of vectors. To store embeddings for 400 million users and over 100 million items and querying them in real time is a challenging task. This is where approximate nearest neighbor approaches step in to help. [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), and [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann) are typical libraries that are used for efficient vector similarity search at scale. They implement algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM.\n","\n","In the first part of this week's project, we will simulate embeddings of 500k items and try to find the k-nearest neighbours for an item of interest. We will implement a vanilla search function to fetch the top-k nearest neighbors and estimate the time it takes for us to do so. We will then compare this with Faiss -- Facebook's nearest neighbour search library, and compare the time it takes for us to get nearest neighbours from Faiss versus our own implementation.\n"],"id":"41f1f7cb-9441-4fe1-962e-9e4cb3e3c192"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vq47Wt-0Jan-"},"source":["## **2.
